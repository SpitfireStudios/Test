# Scorp React Test

- just open the code in your IDE and enter npm start into the terminal. It should open in your default browser window.
- Had some issues appying the translation to my navigation bar and had no time to get the login modal applied to the navigation bar, mainly because it pulls the information from a seperate json, requires more debugging.
- Not using a build tool but you can find the `index.html`in `public`
